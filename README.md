### 🔎 Who am I
My name is Lee Perkins, I am a full stack developer wanting to move into the field of cyber security! I feel comfortable using things like Angular, Mysql, and PHP to develop websites. I have learned many things like Big Data Analysis or AI, but I really enjoy doing Web Development the most. Besides web development, I have also enjoyed doing game development too. I like thinking about game mechanics and how a game works under the hood. Whenever I am programming I aim to develop clean, neat, and optimized code for every system. Keeping code orginized helps not only me, but also others, seamlessly understand which functions and tools can be utilized.

### 🏗️ I’m currently working on
- Building local and public websites for companies
- Making a MMORPG with friends
- Taking on CTF Challenges

### 📚 Languages I know
